"""AP1 long stalk-forward (FWD) toggles Experimental Mode while disengaged.

Pure timing helper. No CAN sockets, no params, no actuation.

SpdCtrlLvr_Stat == 1 is FWD (push away / cancel) in tesla_can.dbc.
BogPilot maps that value to ButtonType.cancel. Short FWD pulses cancel /
disengage; a continuous hold of ~2.0 s while already disengaged is
repurposed as one Experimental Mode toggle. Release returns to IDLE and
re-arms.

Mirrors stalk_pull_hold.StalkPullHold (engaged RWD) with inverted arming:
arm only if openpilot/cruise was NOT engaged at the FWD rising edge, and
abort if engagement happens during the hold. A cancel that starts while
engaged (and may disengage mid-pulse) stays disarmed for that hold.

No panda / TX change — device-side Params toggle only, same as RWD pull.
