# BogPilot

BogPilot is an MIT-licensed research fork of FrogPilot, **Tesla Model S AP1 focused for now**. AP1 support is a fresh port built from BogGyver's Tinkla project, the long-standing AP1 reference. It does not reuse Model 3/Y code.

Owners of other legacy Teslas — **Pre-AP, Model X AP1, and Model S/X AP2** — are welcome to submit rlogs for fingerprinting and integration **in the future**, once all Model S AP1 features have been implemented.

**Not a product. No warranty. The driver remains responsible. Comply with local law.** Not validated as safe to drive. The maintainer has driven it on one AP1 Model S with a comma 3X, but that is a personal impression, not a bench or safety validation.

Pinned FrogPilot SHA: `1e23dec6352cef5a36a87be0af7d7a082b7c48a4`.

## AP1 status (tag `ap1-driving-milestone-4`)

Milestone 4 (2026-10-07) is longitudinal smoothing, merged into the main branch after the maintainer's drive. It sits on top of milestone 3 (the speed-limit and stalk cruise work below).

- **Longitudinal smoothing** (AP1 only; panda safety, `ACCEL_MIN`, stopped distance and the set-speed logic are unchanged):
  - **Brake onset ramp:** regen eases in at 2 m/s³ instead of jumping in one frame; deeper requests ramp faster, and −2 m/s² or harder, FCW and stopping still go through at once.
  - **Drive release 2.0:** lifting off drive torque is a soft S-curve at 2 m/s³ (+1.3 → 0 in about 0.8 s instead of 0.25 s), so a lift no longer feels like regen grabbing.
  - **Throttle cap:** the driving model's on/off "allow throttle" hint is filtered (quick cut, slow release). Throttle/coast chatter dropped from about 24 to about 3 flips a minute on the maintainer's drives.
  - **Standstill hold floor:** while stopped, openpilot asks for at most −1.0 m/s² (was −2.0), so the car latches less Hold pressure to dump at the launch; launch jerk is stock-like (1.5 m/s³).
- **Stalk / SLC refinements since milestone 3:** a tip-engage now holds through speed limit changes in both directions until you pull or disengage; tips go down to 1 mph (never 0); a posted limit under 15 mph is ignored, and a very large sudden drop must persist 2 s before SLC tracking follows it.

- Openpilot steering (angle control on `0x488`) and longitudinal control (`0x2b9`) through one harness and one panda on chassis CAN.
- **Speed limit control (SLC) raise:** with FrogPilot's Speed Limit Controller on, openpilot can set cruise above the stock limit, up to the posted limit plus your offset. From the car, SLC reads the Mobileye sign first, then the car's map limit (FrogPilot's own map sources still apply per your SLC settings).
- **Instrument cluster set speed** follows openpilot's set speed (`DAS_accSpeedLimit`, AP1 DBC scale fix), with a guard so a stopped car no longer flashes ~90 on the cluster.
- **Stalk engage** (the stalk modes below need Speed Limit Controller on; with it off, openpilot uses the car's own cruise set):
  - Tip up or down to engage: holds your **current speed**. It does not jump to the posted limit, and it stays put through speed limit changes, up or down, until you pull the stalk or disengage (curve speed control can still slow below it).
  - Pull the stalk toward you to engage: goes to the **posted limit plus your offset** and follows the limit.
- **While engaged:**
  - Tip up/down to the first position: ±1 mph.
  - Full tip (second position): next multiple of 5 up or down (50 → 55 / 50 → 45). Holding a full tip still moves one step; tip again for the next.
  - A tipped set speed stays put through speed limit zone changes, up or down, until you pull the stalk or disengage. A 15 mph school-zone tip will not pick up the next 25 or 35 sign.
  - Pull the stalk: back to the posted limit plus offset, following lower limits too (a 45 → 30 sign now follows without cancel and re-engage).
- **Experimental Mode from the stalk:**
  - Engaged: hold the stalk pulled for about 2 s.
  - Disengaged: hold the stalk forward for about 2 s.
  - A short pull and a short forward push (cancel) work as before. Known tradeoff: during the engaged 2 s pull the car's own cruise may bump its set speed, and the pull also returns openpilot to the posted limit plus offset.
- Soft steer takeover: gentle start at engage, recovery when EPAS goes inactive, grey border on wheel touch; after a firm override, 0.3 s wait (was 0.5 s) then ease back in from wherever the wheel is.
- Stalk twist changes driving personality and follow distance; Tesla Hold auto-clears when stopped behind a lead car (like Tinkla).
- Instrument cluster shows engaged state, planned path, and lane lines (`0x399`/`0x389`/`0x239`); turn off `EnableICIntegration` for the stock cluster.
- Car selection: there is no AP1 firmware table yet. The comma reads the EPS, brake booster and radar firmware, finds no match, and uses FrogPilot's saved car model (`TESLA_AP1_MODELS`) — not VIN. Other AP1 owners can submit rlogs so their versions can be added.

The full stalk map is in `docs/tesla/STALK.md`. Every place this tree knowingly differs from upstream or Tinkla is listed in `docs/tesla/DIVERGENCES.md`. Credits are in `CREDITS.md`.

### Earlier milestones

- `ap1-driving-milestone-3` (2026-10-07): SLC raise to posted limit + offset, cluster set speed, sticky stalk engage, full-tip next-5, zone-hold tips, stalk-hold Experimental toggles, 0.3 s soft-steer resume.
- `ap1-driving-milestone-2` (2026-10-05): model-path cluster lanes, FCW engage fix, grey override border, 0.5 s resume hold.
- `ap1-driving-milestone-1` (2026-10-04): first AP1 drive with openpilot steering, chassis longitudinal, hands-on pause/resume, and stalk follow profiles.

## Install

On the comma 3X setup screen, choose custom software and enter:

    installer.comma.ai/BogPilot/bogpilot-tesla

The main branch now includes the SLC / stalk cruise work and the milestone 4 longitudinal smoothing above. Longitudinal control needs the DEBUG panda firmware that this branch builds. Do not enter `frogpilot.download`, which installs upstream FrogPilot.

A sister AP1 port built on sunnypilot lives on `BogPilot/sunnypilot` branch `sunny-tesla`. It has not been road-tested.

Using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 275+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.

🌟 Highlight Features
------

### 🚗 Always On Lateral (AOL)

With **"Always On Lateral"**, lane-centering stays active whenever cruise control is on, even when you press the accelerator or brake. This means steering assist won't cut out during manual speed adjustments giving you continuous support through curves, traffic, or mountain roads!

---

### 🧠 Conditional Experimental Mode (CEM)

**["Experimental Mode"](https://blog.comma.ai/090release/#experimental-mode)** lets openpilot drive at the speed it thinks a human would to allow slowing for curves, stopping at stoplights/stop signs, and adapting to traffic. This makes it powerful in complex scenarios, but it's still, well, "experimental" and less predictable than **"Chill Mode"**. But **"Conditional Experimental Mode"** gives you the best of both worlds by automatically switching between **"Chill Mode"** for steady cruising and **"Experimental Mode"** for more advanced situations to help fully automate your driving experience!

**"Conditional Experimental Mode"** switches into **"Experimental Mode"** when conditions like these are met:
- Approaching curves and turns
- Detecting slower or stopped lead vehicles
- Driving below a set speed
- Predicting an upcoming stop (e.g. stoplight or stop sign)

Once conditions clear it returns to **"Chill Mode"** for stability and predictability.

**Note: Stay attentive as "Experimental Mode" is an alpha feature and mistakes are expected!**

---

### 🎭 Driving Personalities

With **"Driving Personalities"**, you choose how the vehicle behaves with four adjustable profiles:

- **Traffic:** Catered towards stop-and-go traffic by minimizing gaps and delays  
- **Aggressive:** Aimed to provide tighter following distances and quicker reactions  
- **Standard:** Useful for a balanced, all-purpose driving  
- **Relaxed:** A smoother driving experience with larger following distance gaps  

Each profile can be fine-tuned to change the desired following distance, acceleration, and braking style letting you shape **FrogPilot**'s behavior to match your own driving preferences! Profiles can be switched instantly using the following distance button on the steering wheel, while **"Traffic Mode"** can be enabled by simply holding down the following distance button.

---

### 📏 Speed Limit Controller (SLC)

With **"Speed Limit Controller"**, **FrogPilot** automatically adapts to the road's posted speed using information from downloaded **["OpenStreetMap"](https://www.openstreetmap.org)** maps, online **["Mapbox"](https://www.mapbox.com)** data, and the vehicle's dashboard (if supported).

Offsets let you fine-tune how closely **FrogPilot** follows posted limits across different speed ranges allowing you to cruise slightly above or below for a more natural driving experience. If no speed limit is available, you can choose whether **FrogPilot** drives at the set speed, falls back to the last known speed limit, or uses **"Experimental Mode"** to estimate one with the driving model.

Maps can be downloaded directly in settings and updated automatically on a schedule ensuring your device always has the latest speed limits!

**Note: Speed limits are only as accurate as the available speed limit data. Always stay attentive and adjust your speed when necessary!**

---

### 🎨 Themes

With **"Themes"**, you can personalize **FrogPilot**'s driving screen to make it uniquely yours! Choose from:

- **Color Schemes**
- **Icon Packs**
- **Sound Packs**
- **Turn Signal Animations**
- **Steering Wheel Icons**

Enjoy pre-existing **FrogPilot** and seasonal holiday themes, or you can create your own with the **"Theme Maker"** and even share them with the community! For extra fun, enable features like the Mario Kart–style **"Rainbow Path"** or **"Random Events"** that add playful visual effects while you drive!
