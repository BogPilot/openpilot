"""AP1 comfort-band accel slew for DAS_control (CarController side only).

Route 0000002a: the planner aTarget is the only source of request jitter.
CarController passes it straight through (LongControl PID gains are 0) and
DAS_control tells the DI it may follow at +/-8 m/s^3 (stock AP1 DAS sends
roughly +/-0.2 to +/-1.2). Planner jerk on that drive: p95 0.7, p99 1.9
m/s^3; the larger steps cluster around radar lead jumps and show up as
one-plan-step reversals (brake blip then back to gas, gas blip then back).

Rising requests (more accel, or a brake release) are slewed at
AP1_RISE_JERK. Falling requests are slewed as described under "Regen onset
ramp" below; a request at or below AP1_BRAKE_HARD_ACCEL, an FCW, or the
LongControl stopping state passes through on the same step. The output
always lies between the last output and the planner value. ACCEL_MIN/MAX,
the panda limits, STOP_DISTANCE and the planner are untouched.

Below AP1_SLEW_MIN_SPEED the request passes through (and seeds the slew):
the standstill hold sits at -2.0 and the launch jumps to about +0.3, which
a 2.5 m/s^3 slew would delay by ~0.9 s.

Inactive (no DAS_control) resets. The gas-neutral frame seeds 0.0, which is
what the DI last saw, so the request after a driver press ramps from 0.

Ap1JerkLimit picks the DAS_jerkMin / DAS_jerkMax magnitude sent with each
0x2b9 frame. Stock AP1 DAS sent about +/-0.2 to +/-1.2 m/s^3 on 02a (wider
with a wider accel window); openpilot always sent +/-8. In the comfort band
this sends +/-AP1_COMFORT_JERK_LIMIT. As the request sent falls from
AP1_JERK_BLEND_START to AP1_BRAKE_BYPASS_ACCEL the magnitude blends linearly
up to the full 8, and at or below AP1_BRAKE_BYPASS_ACCEL (or on an urgent
frame) it is the full 8, so real braking is never held back by the DI.
The field is always at least the regen ramp jerk being sent once the request
is past AP1_BRAKE_BYPASS_ACCEL. Widening is immediate; narrowing back to the comfort
value is rate limited (AP1_JERK_LIMIT_NARROW_RATE) so the limit itself never
steps down. Below AP1_SLEW_MIN_SPEED, while inactive, and on the gas-neutral
frame it is the full 8 (the old behavior).

Regen onset ramp (road test of 6914de87, route 0000002e). The planner turns
a sudden drop in its plan into an overshooting step: aTarget is
2 * (v(0.55 s) - v0) / 0.55 - a0, so when the plan's current accel a0 is
+1.2 and the plan falls to about -0.2 (allowThrottle going false, or a lead
first seen at 86 m), aTarget lands near -1.1 (clipped to -0.88) in one 50 ms
step while the plan itself only reaches -0.4 to -0.6 over the next second.
6914de87 passed every falling request at or below -0.5 through on the same
step, so DAS_control went from +1.36 to -0.92 in one frame and the DI swung
motor torque from +106 to -73 Nm in about 0.3 s.

Falling requests now follow the stock DI's shape after a cruise cancel:
drive torque is released (gently since smooth3: see "Drive release" below)
while the last output is above 0, and regen ramps in (AP1_BRAKE_ONSET_JERK once at or below 0). The
regen ramp jerk grows with the depth of the request, from
AP1_BRAKE_ONSET_JERK at AP1_BRAKE_URGENT_ACCEL to the full 8 m/s^3 at
AP1_BRAKE_HARD_ACCEL, and a request at or below AP1_BRAKE_HARD_ACCEL, an FCW,
or the LongControl stopping state passes through on the same step (urgent).
Time to reach a falling request from 0: -0.9 in 0.45 s, -1.0 in 0.50 s,
-1.5 in 0.30 s, -1.95 in 0.26 s, -2.0 or below at once; from +1.5 add about
0.3 s for the drive release (worst case -1.0 from +1.5 in 0.80 s). ACCEL_MIN, the planner and panda safety are unchanged.

The jerk fields follow the ramped request (not the raw planner value), so
they widen as the request deepens rather than snapping to 8 at the planner
step; urgent frames send the full 8 immediately.

Standstill hold and launch (brake pedal "thunk", drives 0000002f/30/31).
The DI latches its standstill HOLD brake pressure from the request it sees
when HOLD begins (raw 0x148 brake request: -2.01 m/s^2 -> 216, -1.68 -> 185,
about -0.1 -> 132-171) and on resume dumps that pressure in 0.13-0.24 s
whatever launch accel is sent; the iBooster then returns the pedal to rest in
about 0.55 s. The stock DAS (bus 2 shadow) sends accelMin 0 and jerk +/-1.2
at standstill instead of our -2.0 and +/-8. So once the car is at standstill
(and there is no FCW) a deeper request is relaxed up to
AP1_STANDSTILL_HOLD_ACCEL at AP1_STANDSTILL_RELAX_JERK, so HOLD latches less
pressure and there is less to dump at the launch. A launch request at or
above that value passes through on the same step (no added launch delay), and
nothing changes while the car is still moving. Ap1JerkLimit sends jerkMax
AP1_LAUNCH_JERK_MAX (stock-like) below AP1_SLEW_MIN_SPEED; jerkMin stays at
the full 8 so braking is never limited. Whether the DI rate-limits its HOLD
release by DAS_jerkMax is untested.
