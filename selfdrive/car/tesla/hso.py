"""AP1 hands-on pause. No CAN.

Tinkla (501c7de) HSO, default TinklaHso True and TinklaHandsOnLevel 2.0:
EPAS_handsOnLevel >= 2 pauses path lateral (CarController sends type NONE)
and cruise is not dropped. steerTempUnavailableSilent is warning-only. It is
not no-entry and not a soft disable.

carState.steeringPressed is a separate, lower threshold: any non-zero
EPAS_handsOnLevel (AP1_DRIVER_INPUT_LEVEL). That is the stock Tesla port and
frog_ap1 mapping. It raises steerOverride, controlsd goes to the overriding
state, and the prebuilt UI draws the grey border. Logged AP1 EPAS reports
levels 0, 1 and 3 only (never 2), so a >= 2 steeringPressed only fired on the
brief level 3 peaks and the border stayed green while the driver steered.

The 50-frame numb period and the 15 degree handoff in HSO_module.py are
not applied. Resume waits for Ap1DriverYield: hands back at level 0 for
AP1_RESUME_HOLD_S, then the measured-angle soft-start, if cruise is still
enabled and EPAS is not EAC_FAULT. Code 6 and a latched
code 3 do not block that resume. Any other non-idle name stays a steer warning.
