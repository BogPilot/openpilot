"""AP1 long stalk-pull (RWD) toggles Experimental Mode while engaged.

Pure timing helper. No CAN sockets, no params, no actuation.

SpdCtrlLvr_Stat == 2 is RWD (pull toward the driver) in tesla_can.dbc.
BogPilot maps that value to ButtonType.resumeCruise. Short RWD pulses
engage / resume; a continuous hold of ~2.0 s while already engaged is
repurposed as one Experimental Mode toggle. Release returns to IDLE and
re-arms.

Evidence from AP1 rlogs (routes 10/11/12/17): RWD asserts continuously
for the pulse seen on the bus (spring stalk). Observed RWD holds were
70–140 ms (taps). No ≥0.5 s hold appeared in those logs — a 2.0 s hold
requires holding against the spring so SpdCtrlLvr stays at 2.

DISABLED (PULL_HOLD_ENABLED = False). Drive 18 showed the stock DI treats a
held RWD pull as resume: ~0.7 s into the hold the cruise set speed jumped
from the current speed back to the remembered one (15 -> 31 mph) and
openpilot accelerated toward it before Experimental Mode toggled. The
gesture cannot be separated from the DI resume on the car side, so the
toggle stays off. The timing helper and its tests are kept.
