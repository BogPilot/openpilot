"""AP1 allowThrottle smoothing (planner side).

The planner caps the MPC's max accel at the coast accel (about -0.3 m/s^2)
whenever the driving model's gasPressProbs[1] is below 0.4 (allowThrottle).
On the e3574753 drives (routes 0000002f/30/31) that flag flipped 10-46 times
a minute while engaged, often for a single 50 ms plan step. Each flip moved
the MPC max-accel limit from about +2 to -0.3 in one step; the plan collapses
and the planner's aTarget formula (2 * (v(action_t) - v0) / action_t - a0)
turns the collapse into a step of up to -2.2 m/s^2 (route 00000030 18:39:45.69
and 18:39:56.69 ET), which then passes through the regen ramp's -2.0
hard-brake bypass. About half of the plan steps larger than 0.4 m/s^2 on those
routes sat within 0.1 s of a flip.

Ap1ThrottleCap turns the flag into a cut fraction (0 = no cap, 1 = the stock
coast cap) with an asymmetric first-order filter, and the planner blends the
MPC max accel linearly toward the coast cap by that fraction:
  - toward "no throttle" with AP1_THROTTLE_CUT_TAU (0.15 s): a single-frame
    flip moves the cap about a quarter of the way instead of all the way, and
    a sustained "no throttle" reaches 90% of the coast cap in about 0.4 s;
  - back toward throttle with AP1_THROTTLE_RELEASE_TAU (1.5 s), so a model
    that keeps hinting "no throttle" (chatter) keeps most of the cap. The
    e3574753 chatter acted as early caution before a lead appeared; a pure
    debounce or an upstream-style ramped limit dropped it and in replay of
    0000002e 16:09 ET (lead first seen at 86 m) closed the min gap from 34.5
    to about 27 m with -1.8 m/s^2 braking. This filter keeps 33.8 m / -1.17.
At or below MIN_ALLOW_THROTTLE_SPEED (creep) and while the planner is reset
(not engaged) it follows the raw flag at once. Only the max-accel limit is
affected: braking limits, FCW, the lead cost and ACCEL_MIN are unchanged.
AP1 only; other cars keep the stock 0/1 cut.
