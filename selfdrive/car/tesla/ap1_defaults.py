"""One-time BogPilot toggle profile for the Tesla AP1 Model S.

AP1 is never auto-fingerprinted: owners pick "Tesla AP1 Model S" under
Vehicle Settings, which stores CarModel=TESLA_AP1_MODELS. The first time
BogPilot sees that (at boot, or offroad when settings close), it applies the
maintainer's recommended toggles below, once:

  - a Params key is written only if its current value still equals the
    frogpilot_default_params table default, so anything the owner already
    changed stays put
  - a /data/params_bogpilot file toggle is written only if the file is absent
  - then /data/params_bogpilot/AP1DefaultsApplied is written so it never runs
    again. "Reset toggles to default" (DoToggleReset) deletes that marker, so
    a reset re-applies the AP1 profile. "Reset to stock" leaves it alone.

No new Params keys (the prebuilt params_pyx.so raises on unknown keys): the
marker and the file toggles live in /data/params_bogpilot. Nothing here touches
CarParams, panda safety, or driving code; it only stores toggle values.

The profile only lists values that differ from the table defaults, except the
few in EXPLICIT_DEFAULT_KEYS that are spelled out on purpose. Keys that are
secret, personal, or tied to one device or car are never part of it (see
NEVER_PROFILE_KEYS); the tests enforce that.

Speed-limit offsets are kept in mph (AP1_SPEED_OFFSETS_MPH). On a metric device
(IsMetric) they are converted to km/h and rounded before writing, because the
Offset params are stored in the device's display unit.

Theme: Icon Pack, Sound Pack, Turn Signal and Distance Button are set to the
BogPilot theme, whose icons and sounds are copies of the stock openpilot files
(frogpilot/assets/bogpilot_theme). Color Scheme and Steering Wheel are set to
the literal "stock" for now, because the prebuilt UI only draws the stock path /
sidebar colors and the stock wheel with its Experimental Mode icon for that
value. A separate one-time step (marker AP1ThemeBogPilot) also moves Icon Pack,
Sound Pack and Turn Signal values that only pick the stock look ("stock", or
"none" for turn signals) to BogPilot, because those render the same. It runs
once per device even where the main profile already ran, and never touches Color
Scheme, Steering Wheel, Distance Button, or a downloaded or user-made theme.
