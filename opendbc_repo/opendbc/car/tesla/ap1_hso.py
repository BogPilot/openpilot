"""AP1 hands-on pause, driver input and resume hold. No CAN.

Ported from BogPilot/openpilot tag ap1-driving-milestone-2 (92e84996)
selfdrive/car/tesla/hso.py. That build was driven by the user on 2026-10-05.

Tinkla (501c7de) HSO, default TinklaHso True and TinklaHandsOnLevel 2.0:
EPAS_handsOnLevel >= 2 pauses path lateral (CarController sends type NONE)
and cruise is not dropped. A temporary steer warning is warning-only. It is
not no-entry and not a soft disable.

carState.steeringPressed is a separate, lower threshold: any non-zero
EPAS_handsOnLevel (AP1_DRIVER_INPUT_LEVEL). That is the stock Tesla port and
frog_ap1 mapping. It raises steerOverride, selfdrived goes to the overriding
state, and the UI draws the grey border. Logged AP1 EPAS reports levels 0, 1
and 3 only (never 2), so a >= 2 steeringPressed only fired on the brief
level 3 peaks and the border stayed green while the driver steered.

The 50-frame numb period and the 15 degree handoff in Tinkla HSO_module.py
are not applied. Resume waits for Ap1DriverYield: hands back at level 0 for
AP1_RESUME_HOLD_S, then the measured-angle soft-start, if cruise is still
enabled and EPAS is not EAC_FAULT. Code 6 and a latched code 3 do not block
that resume. Any other non-idle name stays a steer warning.
